#kobovnc

I am heavily assisted by AI.

A lightweight CLI (command line interface) tool to view a remote screen over VNC, designed to work on eInk screens.
~~For now, you can only view, so you'll have to connect a keyboard to the serving computer, or find some other way to interact with it.~~ There is now touch input, scaling, padding, panning, and a way to quit the program via touch.

This tool has been confirmed to work on Nia.
It was optimized for text based workflows (document reading and writing), doing that it achieves a framerate of 30 fps.

As VNC server we tested successfuly with TightVNC, x11vnc, DroidVNC NG.

## Warning

The screen can refresh up to 30 times per second, this will degrade the eInk display rapidly.
Do not use with fast changing content like videos.

Furthermore, this tool was only tested on Kobo Libra 2 and Kobo Elipsa 2E.
**It is possible that it will damage yours.**
*I cannot be held responsible, use this tool at your own risk.*

## Usage

You can use this tool by connecting to the eInk device through SSH, or using menu launchers on the device itself.

To connect to a VNC server:

``` shell
./einkvnc [Host][Port][OPTIONS]
```
Available options:
- Host:Required, always the first
- Port, the second argument if present
- Username
- Password
- Contrast: apply a post processing contrast filter
- White_cutoff: apply a post processing filter to turn colors greater than the specified value to white (255
- Exclusive: request a non-shared session
- Rotate:1-4
- Scale: fit to width or height
- Longtap: Send right click for windows server by pressing and holding, android and linux servers seem to automatically implement this so no need
- pan:disable click drag for panning
- colour:Use rgb instead of grayscale for colour devices, using this means you cannot adjust contrast

Advanced users:

- partial_update: Choose 1=Fast/A2 2=Fastmono/A2 3=Gui/DU 4=Partial/GL16 5=Full/GC16. Testing on Kobo Nia with:DroidVNC without blue_noise turned on only mode 2 works and you end up with undithered 1 bit colour image, TightVNC both mode 1 and 2 work without the need for blue_noise but heavy detail loss and ghosting. With blue_noise turned on detail loss is less and ghosting seems better too, I think this is due to improved partial update but im not sure, but I thought a2 mode didnt differentiate between full and partial so im not sure. a2 mode does seem to improve cursor trails but only marginally. blue_noise slows down the frame rate though
- full_update: Choose 1=Fast 2=Fastmono 3=Gui 4=Partial 5=Full
- set_dither:Dithers 16 level grayscale. The input color is in {0 .. 255}. The output color is in G16. Grayscale 16
- set_monochrome:unsure exactly wat it do, plato function
- refresh:how often to do full refresh, units is how many rects before full refresh
- fps: Decimal value, 30.0 or 0.5 etc
- blue_noise: For A2/DU mode, use dithering to produce 1bit grayscale

For example:

``` shell
./einkvnc 192.168.2.1 5902 --password abcde123 --contrast 2 
```
NickelMenu entry
```
menu_item:main:VNCTest:cmd_spawn:quiet:killall -TERM nickel hindenburg sickel fickel adobehost foxitpdf iink dhcpcd-dbus dhcpcd fmon; /mnt/onboard/einkvnclatestrelease 192.168.1.150 5900 --password password; /mnt/onboard/.adds/plato-0.9.45/nickel.sh
```
Place the einkvnc file onto your kobo ereader drive, then use the location of the file to run.
eg /mnt/onboard/einkvnc. the . before the / means current directory. Rename the file to einkvnc instead of einkvncrelease or einkvncdebug

For faster framerates, use USB networking (see https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254214).

Rotate to landscape display using flag --rotate 2 or --rotate 0

~~Use a resolution smaller than or exactly equal to your display. eg common resolution of 1024x768 will fail to work correctly on Kobo Nia because 1024x758 is the maximum. Custom resolution of 1024x758 works!~~

To stop all other programs use this command before launching eink-vnc, so you can use touch input. From koreader startup script.

```
killall -q -TERM nickel hindenburg sickel fickel strickel fontickel adobehost foxitpdf iink dhcpcd-dbus dhcpcd bluealsa bluetoothd fmon nanoclock.lua
killall -TERM nickel hindenburg sickel fickel adobehost foxitpdf iink dhcpcd-dbus dhcpcd fmon
```
These commands can restart nickel from ssh.
```
(tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$(pidof -s nickel)/environ | grep -E '^(USER|SHLVL|LD_LIBRARY_PATH|HOME|TERM|PATH|LANG|SHELL|PWD|DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS|NICKEL_HOME|PLATFORM|PRODUCT|WIFI_MODULE|INTERFACE|UBOOT_MMC|UBOOT_RECOVERY|runlevel|prevlevel|boot_port|waveform_p|waveform_sz|hwcfg_p|hwcfg_sz|ntxfw_p|ntxfw_sz|QT_GSTREAMER_PLAYBIN_AUDIOSINK|QT_GSTREAMER_PLAYBIN_AUDIOSINK_DEVICE_PARAMETER|LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_)=' | sed 's/^/export /')
killall -TERM nickel hindenburg sickel fickel adobehost foxitpdf iink dhcpcd-dbus dhcpcd fmon
cd /mnt/onboard/.adds/plato-0.9.45
/mnt/onboard/.adds/plato-0.9.45/nickel.sh
```

Failed to fill whole buffer error? You messed up somewhere in login credentials or server side ip blocking.

Changelog:

- I have fixed ZRLE DroidVNC NG issues using Claude AI
  - zrle.rs 
	- adding (false, 17..=127) to zrle decode fn,
	- changing copy_indexed fn to return result,
	- remove '&& format.depth <= 24' condition in decode fn for 32bpp, as droid vnc server depth is 32 not 24, other servers have depth of 24 not 32. Forcing 8bpp allowed the oldest einkvnc to ignore this.
  - main.rs:forcing the colour format to 8bpp, as the oldest version did, call vnc.request_update only at end of each frame, instead of each event, apparently this combined with debug mode can cause server to close connection.
- Grayscale conversion using RGB instead of R
- I have changed rotation default to use plato's function
- I have added a contingency device detection using /mnt/onboard/.kobo/version instead of using environment variables because starting the tool over ssh does not pass those values. 
- I have also setup touchscreen functionality from plato and rustvnc.
- I have copied over the ClaraColor and LibraColor device.rs from plato's latest version, 
- added scaling, padding, added gesture swiping recognition from plato
- If killed nickel beforehand program will be able to read power button events, power button or sleep cover will quit vnc and restart nickel, unless you started from ssh in which case it will not be able to restart nickel. Hold touchscreen for more than 6 seconds to exit without restarting nickel regardless of ssh start or not. If you want to be able to restart nickel, have take plato's nickel.sh and place inside .adds folder. the path is hardcoded, otherwise you can use nickelmenu to restart nickel too see below
- copied latest framebuffer code from plato, probably wasnt necessary, could have added small changes to add mark 12 code without needing to copy over all other rest of files but i have no device to test it with
- add panning for resolutions bigger than device can handle
- minor other changes
